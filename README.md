# particlesim


1) This code creates a particle simulator. The particle system is made up of 10,000 particles, each with a random position in space from a 2D plane. The camera used to view the particle system can be controlled using an OrbitControls object, which allows the user to pan, zoom, and rotate the camera. Inside the animate function we can control all the particles with different event listener buttons to play around with the particles.

2) To do this, I used the WebGL renderer and used two Three.js libraries.
